<h1>My First Website</h1>
  
  
  Hi my name is Jordan Hernandez. I am a ninth grade student and this is my first year taking a programing class. This is also my first website. School is very important to me. I always try to do my best so that I can succeed in life. When I'm not in school, I like to race my gokart in the Homestead AMR karting challenge along with my team Rysa Racing. I also fly scale sized RC airplanes with my grandpa.
