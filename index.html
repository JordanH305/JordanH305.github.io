<h1>My First Website</h1>
<body style="background-color:aqua">
  Hi my name is Jordan Hernandez. I am a ninth grade student and this is my first year taking a programing class. This is also my first website. When I'm not in school, I like to race my gokart with my dad and our team called  Rysa Racing. I also like to ride bike with my grandpa and my cousins. School is very important to me. I always try to do my best so that I can succeseed in life.
