<p>
Hi 8th graders! Coral Gables High has many programs to choose from, but IB is the best. IB is a four year course starting with pre IB in your freshman and softmore years, and ending with IB in your junior and senior years. IB is a little challenging at first, but as time goes on, you get used to it. In IB, you will need to take a few exams, but if you listen and do your work in class, you will be fine. If you complete the IB program all the way through senior year and you pass all your exams, then you will get a full ride scholarship. This means you will get your college 100% free. Hope to see you guys next year!
